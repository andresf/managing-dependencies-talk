# What dependencies do you see?

Remember: A dependency is anything that will cause further code to change

    @@@ruby
      class Karaoke
        def initialize(video, song_file, song_lyrics)
          @video       = video
          @song_file   = song_file
          @song_lyrics = song_lyrics
        end

        def duration
          song = Song.new(@song_file, @song_lyrics)
          [@video.length, song.length].max
        end
      end

      class Song
        def initialize(file, lyrics)
          @file   = file
          @lyrics = lyrics
        end
